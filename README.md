## Self-hosting
This step-by-step guide assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `16.9.0` or higher installed and that you have a Discord Bot user set up at [Discord's developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that has been invited to your server with the scopes `applications.commands` and `bot`.

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a file named `.env`  in the root directory and insert your bot's Discord API token and Application ID:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_API_TOKEN=abcd1234...
   CLIENT_ID=123456...
   ```
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm deploy`. This will make the slash commands show up in the servers the bot are in, but **it can take up to _ONE HOUR_ before they show up**.
5. Make sure the bot has the required permissions in Discord:
   - [x] View channels
   - [x] Send messages
   - [x] Send messages in threads
   - [x] Create public threads
   - [x] Read message history
6. Run `npm start`
7. Deploy! :tada:
