## üëã Getting started

The easiest way to start using Needle in your server is to use the hosted instance. [Click here to invite Needle to your Discord server](https://needle.gg/invite)!

## üõ†Ô∏è Self-hosting (advanced)

The hosted instance of Needle is customizeable and should be enough for most users. However, if you have special requirements and want to modify the functionality of Needle, you will have to fork the repository and self-host your own instance. This requires programming knowledge and is only for advanced users - support for this will be limited.

Needle requires an environment with Node.js version `16.9.0` or higher, along with persistent storage for per-server config files - shared hosts (like Replit and Heroku) will not work.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MarcusOtter/discord-needle/releases/latest) of Needle and extract the archive.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your bot's token and application ID.
3. Run `npm install` to install Needle's dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to compile Needle's code.
5. Run `npm run deploy` to setup slash commands.
    - Slash commands can take **up to one hour** to show up in all servers.
6. Run `npm start` to start Needle :tada:

Needle requires the following permissions to function, along with the `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes.

-   [x] View channels
-   [x] Send messages
-   [x] Send messages in threads
-   [x] Create public threads
-   [x] Read message history

You can use this link to invite your self-hosted version of Needle, replacing `<APP ID>` with your bot's application ID: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<APP ID>&permissions=309237713920&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

### üê≥ Docker

Needle has an [official Docker image](https://github.com/MarcusOtter/discord-needle/pkgs/container/discord-needle). Releases are tagged by their minor & patch version (e.g. `2.0.0` & `2.0`), with the latest release tagged `latest`. Branches are tagged by their name. To run the image, write the following command, replacing `token` with your bot's token:

```sh
docker run -d --name Needle --env DISCORD_API_TOKEN=token discord-needle ghcr.io/MarcusOtter/discord-needle:latest
```

By default, this will create an anonymous volume for `/configs`. To change the location, add `-v /path/to/configs:/configs` to the command.

There is also an [example `docker-compose.yml` file](https://github.com/MarcusOtter/discord-needle/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

You'll still need to deploy Needle's slash commands - follow the regular self-hosting instructions apart from step 6.
